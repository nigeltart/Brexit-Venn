# Brexit-Venn
My first data visualisation - an animated Venn diagram to show the movement of the UK within Europe <br> <br>

Designed in PowerPoint then recorded as a gif<br>
I like how the Powerpoint animation hits the edge then bounces back in slightly, as if the UK were trying to physically leave Europe.<br><br>
